For example, when describing potential consequences of actions. \n\n#### Component names \n\nLower case, unless at the start of a sentence. Exception: When used in a code snippet, component names take the same case as used in the code, for example camel case. \n\n#### When to use “Content” vs “Text” \n- Use “text” when talking about words, like text strings.\n- Use “content” when referring to a larger concept that might include text, images, and other UI element. \n#### Do and Don’t examples \n- Always add a brief, valuable caption to Do and Don’t examples\n- Do examples take an imperative statement\n- Don’t examples typically take an informative statement\n- Do and Don’t examples can exist on their own. Consider adding a Do if it clarifies the Don’t example. If the Don’t example doesn’t add any new information, consider showing only a Do example\n- Avoid repeating the body content as a caption.\n#### Subheadings \nGenerally use noun or noun phrases.
